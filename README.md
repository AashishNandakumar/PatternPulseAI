## Installation

To install PatternPulseAI, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/PatternPulseAI.git`

2. Install the required dependencies using npm: `npm install`

3. Launch the application: `npm start`



## Usage

Using PatternPulseAI is simple and intuitive. Once you have installed the application, open it in your web browser. You'll be presented with an interface where you can input Morse code using dots and dashes. Click on the "Decode" button, and PatternPulseAI will swiftly translate the Morse code into readable text.

## How It Works

PatternPulseAI employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to analyze the input Morse code signals and extract relevant patterns. The network utilizes its internal memory to understand the temporal dependencies in the sequence of dots and dashes, enabling seamless and efficient Morse code interpretation.

## Dataset

PatternPulseAI is trained on a vast dataset of Morse code examples, covering letters A to Z. The dataset has been carefully curated and cleaned to ensure accurate and reliable decoding.

## Training

To achieve high accuracy, PatternPulseAI undergoes extensive training using the aforementioned dataset. The RNN is trained over multiple iterations, adjusting its internal states and weights to minimize errors and improve performance. This training process helps PatternPulseAI achieve near-human accuracy in Morse code interpretation.

## Model Architecture

PatternPulseAI's neural network architecture consists of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers, optimized using backpropagation through time and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to achieve optimal performance during training and inference.
